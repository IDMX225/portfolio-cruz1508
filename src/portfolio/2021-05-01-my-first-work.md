For this project I created a fake brand about my personal "bakery". In this mini project I learned how to find and keep a consistent color scheme for a "product". This helped put me in the mindset of a person trying to sell a product, and display that brand in a UI friendly way. I also saw how you could use plug-ins to add things like emojis to my projects. A link to the code-pen is for my UI above is <a href="https://codepen.io/cruz1508/pen/bGXqNGw">here</a>
