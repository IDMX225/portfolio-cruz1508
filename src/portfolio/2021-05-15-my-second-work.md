Above is a image of my second website, my poem website. This was created in my second Website Developement class. Here I learned Sass to help organize material and use more advance code. I also learned how to use Open Prompts to help resuse code and be more efficent with creating website code. I was also learning code like the "clamp" function which helps accurately downsize text size in different screen sizes. Another notable thing I learned was creating custom favicons. The most difficult part of this was learning  the Clamp function. It hard to understand (and it still is) but im glad I was able to further enhance my Web Dev skills.
