description: This is a mini 3D card project I did recently. It was fun to work with and learn more niche HTML and CSS elements!

Here is my color card project. Here I learned to use the "preserve-3d" and "translateZ" elements to create a 3d Card that flips when hovered over with a cursor. This was a cool mini project to help me learn how to create more interactive parts of my future websites. A link to the website is <a href= https://cardflipcruz1508.netlify.app> here</a>.
