Here is my "About Me" Website. This was my first website ever created in my first Web Development Class. Here I learned learned the basic's of html and css. I was learning things like div statements, incorporating custom fonts and font sizes, adding photos, media states, and many more. Here in my website I created multiple different blurbs about me personally. Such has showing my videogame collection, my personal gaming setup, some of my hobbies, and many more information. If you want to check it out yourself, the link to the website itself is <a href="https://about-me-cruz1508.netlify.app">here</a>. A link to the Github Repo is also <a href="https://github.com/RVCC-IDMX/about-me-cruz1508">here</a>
